                This significant event took place in the esteemed presence of Hazrat Tajush Shariah, the successor to the Grand Mufti of India قدس سره. Hazrat Qazi Abdul Rahim Bastavi conveyed that Hazrat Mufti Azam of India قدس سره himself recounted this important tradition to him at Razavi Darul Ifta. On Tuesday, 15th Muharram 1411 AH, the esteemed faqih Mufti Muhammad Mati-ur-Rahman Razavi دام عناياته affirmed that Hazrat Mufti Azam of India قدس سره, personally narrated this tradition to him. (Mufti Azam and His Caliphs, p. 84)

                Hadrat Mufti Azam of India consistently issued fatwas from the esteemed Razavi Darul Ifta throughout his lifetime. However, following his passing, the once-great prominence of this historic institution began to wane. The order, structure, and organization have undoubtedly transformed from what they were during the lifetime of the Grand Mufti of India.

                The Dar-ul-Ifta has, over time, lost its prominence, leading to a distortion of its original status and purpose. This gradual obscurity has fostered the perception among people that it exists merely as a source of blessing and a symbolic notion.

            <p>
                The revered light of the family of Aala Hazrat, the heart of our nation and its guiding Caliph, embodies the essence of the TajushShariah and stands as a powerful manifestation of Hujjat-ul-Islam. Hazrat Allama Mufti Muhammad Arsalan Raza Khan Qadri, Azhari, is destined for greatness. May Allah grant him a long life filled with benefits for the Muslim community. With the blessings of knowledge and the inspiration of his pen, he continues to shine brightly, especially as we honour the Urs of Mufassir-e-Azam Hind Quds, following the departure of the Tajush Shariah. His contributions are invaluable, and he will undoubtedly lead us forward with wisdom and grace.
